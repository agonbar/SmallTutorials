GETTING STARTED
===============

This guide will be focused on development in Windows, for OSX or Linux tutorials, please send me a request.
We will start by installing NodeJS as a server and Atom as the editor, but Notepad++ or Sublime Text are both valid options.

INSTALL ATOM
------------
* Download the [Windows installer](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/download/v1.12.4/AtomSetup.msi).
* Run the installer (the .msi file you downloaded in the previous step.)
* Follow the prompts in the installer (Accept the license agreement, click the NEXT button a bunch of times and accept the default installation settings).

###PACKAGES

Atom is very extendable with themes and plugins, for now we'll be using [script-runner](https://atom.io/packages/script-runner) to avoid using the terminal, but theres plenty of packages to explore and I highly recommend to do it once we get used to the enviroment. To install packages, press the buttons ctrl+shift+p (all at the same time) and a search menu will appear. In the search menu type the keywords *Install packages* and click *Settings View:Install Packages and Themes*.

> We will search for script-runner and hit install

INSTALL NODEJS
---------------
* Download the [Windows installer](https://nodejs.org/dist/v7.1.0/node-v7.1.0-x64.msi).
* Run the installer (the .msi file you downloaded in the previous step.)
* Follow the prompts in the installer (Accept the license agreement, click the NEXT button a bunch of times and accept the default installation settings).
* Restart your computer. You wonâ€™t be able to run NodeJS until you restart your computer.
